# -----------------------------------  MetaFlux .fba File Template  ---------------------------------
# 
# Valid for Pathway Tools Version 23.0
# Last update: Apr-7-2019  
#
# This file is a general template to create an FBA input file for the
# MetaFlux module of Pathway Tools. All possible parameter keywords appear 
# in this file, but values for many of the parameters are optional. You will need 
# to complete appropriate parameters according to your PGDB and what you intend
# to do with MetaFlux.
#
# This file contains some comments describing the parameter syntax and semantics, 
# but for a more complete documentation, please consult the chapter "MetaFlux: 
# Flux Balance Analysis" in the Pathway Tools User Guide.
#
# Each parameter name ends with ':' and is not case-sensitive. You can
# leave a parameter without any specification (i.e., empty line(s)) unless otherwise stated.
#
# The character '#' is used to write comments: the rest of the line
# after a '#' is ignored.
#
# MetaFlux can operate in five different modes.
#
# 1) [Development Mode] If at least one try set is not empty, or
#    'try-add-reverse-rxns' is set to 'yes', the FBA analysis is a gap-filling FBA,
#    that is, you are in development mode, not in solving mode. 
#    In development mode, you are trying to complete an FBA model.
#
# 2) [Fast Development Mode] If the parameter 'fast-development-mode' is set to 'yes',
#    MetaFlux will run in Fast Development Mode. In this mode, the gap-filling
#    is done only on the set of reactions. Moreover, this mode might provide
#    more than one solution to complete your model.
#
# 3) [Knockout Mode] If any knockout parameter is specified, this file 
#    describes a knockout experiment.
#
# 4) [Solving Mode] If all try sets are empty, it is a standard 
#    FBA analysis. You have a working FBA model that you want to compute
#    the exact fluxes for reactions, biomass, secretions, and nutrients.
#
# 5) [Flux Variability Analysis Mode] An extension to Solving Mode is
#    the Flux Variability Analysis tool. This tool only works on a working
#    FBA model. FVA can be applied to a subset of reactions as defined
#    under the fva-reaction-list: keyword or all reactions under the 
#    reactions: keyword in the .fba file.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# A pgdb is a unique symbol denoting a PGDB (e.g., ecoli).
# This symbol is called an organism identifier, or orgid.
# You can write 'current-pgdb', and the PGDB used will be the one
# currently selected in the FBA tool when this file is loaded in 
# MetaFlux. But we strongly suggest to enter a specific organism identifier 
# (orgid) that references one PGDB.
# Most of the metabolites and reactions described in this file are
# assumed to come from the specified pgdb.

# The fixed set of reactions for the model -- may be empty. 
# The word 'metab-all' can be used to specify all metabolic reactions 
# of the pgdb. Additional reactions can be specified by their unique
# identifiers (frame-ids) or through a reaction equation.

reactions:
metab-all

# The reactions specified here will not be include in the generated model -- may be empty.
# These reactions are removed from the fixed reactions set.
# Remove-reactions is useful if 'metab-all' contains some reactions
# you do not want to include in the FBA model.

remove-reactions:


# The try-reactions parameter describes the reactions to try to add to
# the FBA model to increase its objective function -- may be empty.  Use 
# the word 'metacyc-metab-all' to include all MetaCyc metabolic reactions. 
# You can also add specific reactions using reaction IDs or reaction equations.
# If you specify a non empty set for try-reactions, you should either setup the
# try-optimize parameter appropriately (recommended) or select the appropriate
# weights (advanced settings).

#           Objectives for General Development Mode
# =====================================================================

# The try-optimize parameter is the RECOMMENDED way to control the
# desired result of general development mode. It consists of
# specifying for each try set if it should be minimized or maximized,
# the priority of optimization (e.g., should the number of biomass
# metabolites be maximized before minimizing the number of try
# reactions to add), and the upper/lower bounds on the numbers of
# suggested elements to add to a try-set. For each try set, the upper
# bound specifies a maximum number of elements to suggest to add whereas a
# lower bound specifies a minimum number of elements to suggest to add. 
#
# IMPORTANT: The try-optimize parameter overrides many of the weights specified 
# under the banner "Try-Set Weights for Advanced Users". See that section
# for more details.
#
# Note: this try-optimize specification becomes effective if at least
#       one non empty try set is specified in this file, 
#       such as try-biomass.
#
# If no upper-bound is specified for a try set, a default is used:
#
#        try-biomass,     default to :upper-bound 200
#        try-reactions,   default to :upper-bound 50
#        try-secretions,  default to :upper-bound 20
#        try-nutrients,   default to :upper-bound 20
#
# All lower-bound values default to 0.
#
# The following try-optimize parameter is the default.
#
try-optimize:
    maximize try-biomass      :lower-bound 0 :upper-bound 200
    minimize try-reactions    :lower-bound 0 :upper-bound 50
    minimize try-nutrients    :lower-bound 0 :upper-bound 20

# For knockout-genes, list the genes to knockout. Genes can be speficied in

# knockout-reactions:


# For knockout-nb-genes a single integer must be specified. Its value

# knockout-nb-reactions: 0  # remove the fist '#' to do reaction knockout.


# For knockout-summary-only either the word 'yes' or 'no'

# to turn off its production if you are confident that your model is fine or that the
# log file will not provide any new information.
# Set log-file to yes if you want a .log file to be produced; otherwise set it to no.

log-file: yes


# Some reactions have no curated direction stored in the PGDB.
# In such a case, the direction might be inferred using other information
# available in the PGDB, such as pathways. If the following parameter
# is set to 'yes', no such inference is applied, and all non-curated
# reactions are assumed to be reversible. Default to 'no'.
# If 'yes', all reactions that are active in a different direction
# than the inferred one will be reported in the solution file. Some of
# these reactions might be candidates for a curated direction.
# This parameter can be used in any mode.

treat-rxns-without-dir-reversible: no

#           Try-Set Weights for Advanced Users
# ======================================================================

# IMPORTANTE NOTE: if the try-optimize parameter is given above, many of the
# following weight specifications are NOT taken into account. See each weight
# parameter below for details.

# This section is for advanced users because it is most likely that
# the try-optimize parameter can do exactly what you want. The following
# weights can be changed if you want to fine tune the development
# mode beyond what the try-optimize parameter provides.

# If all try-sets are empty, the weights are not used. In other
# words, a weight is only useful in development mode, not in solving
# mode. A weight is only meaningful if a corresponding try-set is
# specified for it. 

# The weight of adding one metabolite to the biomass. 
# Typically, this value is positive and at least ten times larger, 
# in absolute value, than all the other weights.
