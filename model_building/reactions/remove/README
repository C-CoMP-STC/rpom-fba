Removed to rename to PYRUVDEH-RXN: PDH

gap_filled.json ===================================================================================

Removed for apparently erroneous gap-filling:

VALINE-PYRUVATE-AMINOTRANSFER-RXN
Gap-filled for alanine biosynthesis I. However, gene SPO2014 exists for alanine biosynthesis III
in both DBs, and as the Biocyc page notes, that the contribution of the alanine biosynthesis I pathway
is unclear, as it contains reversible reactions involved in other physiological processes. Both
other genes in the pathway are present in both DBs. Running blastp on the E coli protein
(valineâ€”pyruvate aminotransferase, avtA) finds SPO3230 (E=3e-11), SPOA0066 (E=1e-07)...
Reverse blastp on SPO3230 finds E. coli's ydcR as top result (E=4e-36) with avtA as result #4 (E=1e-12).
Alignment of AlphaFold structures shows some homology, but not great RMSD.

RXN-22218

Removed while fixing an issue where the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway was not running when expected.
My notes from that expedition:

RXN-6383 is the other newly added reaction that, when knocked out, turns on the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway.
It sits in the acrylate degradation (II) pathway downstream of DMSP cleavage, where it probably buffers acryloyl-CoA 
(by conversion to 3-hydroxy-propionyl-CoA) to prevent buildup of this toxic compound. Reisch et al. (2013) show that
the fate of 3-hydroxy-propionyl-CoA is to be converted back into acryloyl-CoA, which is then converted to propionyl-CoA.
That probably rules out any other reactions consuming 3-hydroxy-propionyl-CoA, but not reactions producing it.
 
In short, RXN-6383 is almost certainly actually in the organism. RXN-22218 may not be,
but I've yet to find evidence ruling it out (the above unfortunately falls short).

To summarize, the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway is turned off when growing on acetate because:
1. Acetate is converted to acetyl-CoA, presumably(?) through the usual acetate-CoA ligase.
2. Acetyl-CoA is converted to 3-oxopropanoyl-CoA through:
   - acetaldehyde dehydrogenase: Acetyl-CoA -> acetaldehyde
   - methylthioacryloyl-CoA hydratase (dmdD): Acetaldehyde -> MALONATE-S-ALD (3-oxopropanoate) -> CPD-17259 (3-oxopropanoyl-CoA)
       - ****This is part of the DMSP demethylation pathway running in reverse!****
         I'm not actually sure if this is possible - let's look into the reversibility of these reactions
3. 3-oxopropanoyl-CoA is converted to 3-hydroxypropanoyl-CoA through RXN-22218, which 
   is a biocyc ETL reaction that is not in the original model. It is catalyzed by acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (phbB)
   which is a known enzyme in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway, where it catalyzes the conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA to 3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA.
   **I'm uncertain whether this alternative substrate can actually be processed by phbB.**
4. 3-hydroxypropanoyl-CoA is converted to acrylyl-CoA through RXN-6383, which is also a biocyc ETL reaction that is not in the original model.
   However, it is in the acrylate degradation (II) pathway, which is a known pathway in the organism, so it is probably correct.

tca.json ==========================================================================================
 
Removed RXN-14047 because it's the net of two reactions catalyzed by the same enzyme
(citrate -> cis-aconitate -> threo-ds-isocitrate).

glycolysis.json ===================================================================================

Removed RXN-15513 as a duplicate of 3PGAREARR-RXN catalyzed by the same enzyme.
