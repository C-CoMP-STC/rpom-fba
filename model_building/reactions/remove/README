electron transport chain.json =====================================================================

Removed so as to use ubiquinone 10 only:

    "1.5.5.1-RXN-ETF-Reduced/UBIQUINONE-9//ETF-Oxidized/CPD-9957/PROTON.55.",

    "SUCCINATE-DEHYDROGENASE-UBIQUINONE6-RXN"

sub-reactions.json ================================================================================

Removed as sub-reactions (and sub-sub-reactions) of PDH:
    "RXN0-1134",
        "RXN-12583",
    "RXN0-1133",
    "RXN0-1132"

Removed as sub-reactions of GCVMULTI-RXN:
    "GCVP-RXN",
    "GCVT-RXN",
    "RXN-8629"

rename.json =======================================================================================

Removed to rename to PYRUVDEH-RXN: PDH

gap_filled.json ===================================================================================

Removed for apparently erroneous gap-filling:

VALINE-PYRUVATE-AMINOTRANSFER-RXN
Gap-filled for alanine biosynthesis I. However, gene SPO2014 exists for alanine biosynthesis III
in both DBs, and as the Biocyc page notes, that the contribution of the alanine biosynthesis I pathway
is unclear, as it contains reversible reactions involved in other physiological processes. Both
other genes in the pathway are present in both DBs. Running blastp on the E coli protein
(valineâ€”pyruvate aminotransferase, avtA) finds SPO3230 (E=3e-11), SPOA0066 (E=1e-07)...
Reverse blastp on SPO3230 finds E. coli's ydcR as top result (E=4e-36) with avtA as result #4 (E=1e-12).
Alignment of AlphaFold structures shows some homology, but not great RMSD.

tca.json ==========================================================================================
 
Removed RXN-14047 because it's the net of two reactions catalyzed by the same enzyme
(citrate -> cis-aconitate -> threo-ds-isocitrate).

glycolysis.json ===================================================================================

Removed RXN-15513 as a duplicate of 3PGAREARR-RXN catalyzed by the same enzyme.
