Initially tried to make the DMSP degradation pathway irreversible, but ran into errrors because
it turns out that running some of these reactions in reverse is NECESSARY for growth
IN THE MODEL BEFORE ADDING BIOCYC UPDATES. This behavior seems unrealistic, but then again,
we can't expect never to be surprised.

Seeing as, in the end, I'm not 100% sure that these are irreversible, I'm leaving them as-is for now.

EDIT (9/29): Later investigation found the issue behind why RXN-16013 couldn't be made irreversible
(needed to run in reverse on glucose in order to produce b-alanine.)
Adding an upstream reaction producing deoxycytidine from dCMP fixed the issue.
Now: should I review the reversibilities of these other reactions?
