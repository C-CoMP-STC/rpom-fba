Initially tried to make the DMSP degradation pathway irreversible, but ran into errrors because
it turns out that running some of these reactions in reverse is NECESSARY for growth
IN THE MODEL BEFORE ADDING BIOCYC UPDATES. This behavior seems unrealistic, but then again,
we can't expect never to be surprised.

Seeing as, in the end, I'm not 100% sure that these are irreversible, I'm leaving them as-is for now.
